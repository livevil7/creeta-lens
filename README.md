# Lens

**Never wonder which plugin to use again.**

Lens is a skill navigator for Claude Code by [Creeta](https://www.creeta.com). It scans your installed plugins, finds the best skill for your task, and runs it — all from a single command.

Works with **any** combination of plugins. No hardcoded dependencies.

## The Problem

You installed 10+ plugins. That's 50+ slash commands, MCP tools, and LSP servers. You can't remember them all, and you don't know which combination works best for your task.

## The Solution

```
You: /c build a dashboard with auth

Lens — Skill Scan
| #  | Name          | Type  | Plugin    | Domain   |
|----|---------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1  | /auth-setup   | Skill | plugin-a  | Auth     |
| 2  | /ui-builder   | Skill | plugin-b  | Frontend |
| 3  | context7      | MCP   | context7  | Docs     |
| 4  | typescript    | LSP   | ts-tools  | LSP      |
| .. | ...           | ...   | ...       | ...      |

Total: 30 skills, 3 MCP tools, 2 LSP servers from 10 plugins

Lens — Recommendation

> "Build a dashboard with auth"

Which skill should I run?
  /auth-setup (Recommended) — Auth logic for your app
  /ui-builder — Dashboard UI components
  Other
```

Select a skill and Lens runs it immediately.

## Installation

### Option 1: Load directly from GitHub (Recommended)

Clone the repo and load it with `--plugin-dir`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CreetaCorp/lens.git
claude --plugin-dir ./lens
```

Then use `/lens:c` inside Claude Code.

### Option 2: Copy to your commands (Quick setup)

Copy the skill file to your user-level commands for a shorter `/c` command:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
curl -o ~/.claude/commands/c.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CreetaCorp/lens/main/skills/c/SKILL.md
```

Restart Claude Code, then use `/c` directly.

### Option 3: Load as a local plugin

If you already cloned the repo:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/lens
```

## Usage

### `/c` — Navigate to the best skill

```
/c <what you want to do>
```

| You type | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `/c build a login page` | Recommends your best auth + frontend skill |
| `/c review my PR` | Recommends your code review skill |
| `/c deploy to production` | Recommends your deployment skill |
| `/c` (no args) | Shows full skill inventory |

### `/cc` — Run all relevant skills in parallel

```
/cc <what you want to do>
```

Instead of picking one, `/cc` finds **every** relevant skill and runs them all simultaneously as independent agents, then synthesizes the results.

| You type | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `/cc build a dashboard with auth` | Runs `/auth`, `/ui-builder`, `/code-review` in parallel — one unified output |
| `/cc review this codebase` | Runs every review-related skill at once |
| `/cc` (no args) | Shows full skill inventory (same as `/c`) |

### `/cp` — Plan first, then execute

```
/cp <what you want to do>
```

Unlike `/c` and `/cc`, `/cp` generates a **work plan document** before any execution. The plan is saved as a markdown file and presented for your approval.

| You type | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `/cp build auth with JWT` | Generates a work plan, saves to `docs/2026-02-28-jwt-auth.md`, asks for approval |
| `/cp refactor the API layer` | Creates a step-by-step plan, saves to `docs/`, waits for your go-ahead |
| `/cp` (no args) | Shows full skill inventory (same as `/c`) |

**When to use which:**

| | `/c` | `/cc` | `/cp` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Goal | Best single skill | All relevant skills | Plan before executing |
| Output | One skill's result | Synthesized multi-agent output | Work plan document + execution |
| Speed | Fast | Slower (parallel agents) | Deliberate (plan → approve → execute) |
| Use when | You know what you need | You want comprehensive coverage | You want to review before running |

## How It Works

### `/c` — Single skill navigator
1. **Scan** — Detects all installed skills, MCP tools, and LSP servers
2. **Recommend** — Matches your request to the best skill(s) via AskUserQuestion
3. **Execute** — Runs the chosen skill immediately
4. **Discover** — If no match, suggests installable plugins from registry

### `/cc` — Multi-agent parallel engine
1. **Scan** — Same as `/c`
2. **Multi-Match** — Selects ALL relevant skills (no cap)
3. **Execute** — Launches every matched skill as a parallel Task agent simultaneously
4. **Synthesize** — Collects all outputs and produces a unified result with agreements, conflicts, and next steps

### `/cp` — Plan-first execution engine
1. **Scan** — Same as `/c`
2. **Analyze & Match** — Identifies all relevant skills with reasons
3. **Generate Plan** — Creates a work plan document and saves to project `docs/`
4. **Approve** — Presents plan for user approval (Approve / Modify / Cancel)
5. **Execute** — Runs the approved plan (single skill or parallel agents)
6. **Post-Exec Update** — Appends execution results to the plan file

## Features

- Auto-scans all installed plugins at session start
- Detects Skills, MCP tools, and LSP servers from plugin cache
- **Zero hardcoded dependencies** — works with any plugin combination
- Dynamic keyword matching from scanner-extracted triggers
- Interactive skill selection via AskUserQuestion
- Compares overlapping skills and explains the difference
- Recommends execution order for multi-skill workflows
- **Plan-first execution** — `/cp` generates a work plan document before executing, with user approval
- Plan files saved as `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` in project `docs/` (configurable via `planDir`)
- Agent dashboard — tracks parallel Task agent lifecycle in real-time
- Slash command priority override — `/skill-name` invokes immediately without re-recommendation
- Max 5 recommendations (no overwhelm)
- Responds in your language (EN, KO, JA, ZH, ES, FR, DE, IT)
- Session memory — remembers your most used skills across sessions
- Plugin Discovery — suggests installable plugins when no match found

## Configuration

`lens.config.json`:

```json
{
  "autoRecommend": true,
  "showReport": true,
  "minMatchScore": 5,
  "memoryPath": null,
  "customKeywords": [],
  "planDir": null,
  "defaultPlanLanguage": null,
  "saveSynthesisResults": true,
  "resultsDir": null
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autoRecommend` | `true` | Show skill suggestions in responses |
| `showReport` | `true` | Show Lens tip line when skill matches |
| `minMatchScore` | `5` | Minimum keyword match score for recommendations |
| `memoryPath` | `null` | Custom path for memory file (null = `~/.claude/lens/`) |
| `customKeywords` | `[]` | Additional keyword-to-skill mappings |
| `planDir` | `null` | Custom plan file directory (null = project `docs/`) |
| `defaultPlanLanguage` | `null` | Force plan document language (null = auto-detect) |
| `saveSynthesisResults` | `true` | Save /cc synthesis results to `.lens/results/` |
| `resultsDir` | `null` | Custom results directory (null = `.lens/results/`) |

## Building Custom Skills with Lens

Lens is a navigator, but you can build your own skills that take advantage of the same multi-agent patterns. Here's an example:

**`design-council`** — A skill that summons all installed design agents in parallel, collects their perspectives, and synthesizes a unified design decision.

```markdown
---
name: design-council
description: "Summons all installed design agents in parallel and synthesizes the optimal design decision."
user-invocable: true
---

## Phase 1 — Scan active design agents
Use Glob to find installed agents under ~/.claude/plugins/cache/.

## Phase 2 — Parallel deliberation
Launch each agent via Task tool simultaneously.
Each agent analyzes the task from their domain perspective.

## Phase 3 — Synthesis
Collect all agent outputs and produce a unified recommendation.
```

This pattern works for any domain: security councils, code review boards, architecture committees. Lens's scanner will automatically detect and list any such skill you install.

## Requirements

- Claude Code v1.0.33+
- 2+ plugins installed (otherwise you don't need a navigator)
